## Happy New Year 2026! 🎉

As we step into 2026, I'm excited to share some wonderful news with the academic and research community!

## What's Coming This Year

Over the coming months, I'll be creating and uploading **comprehensive video tutorials and educational content** specifically designed for scholars, researchers, PhD students, faculty, and educators. These tutorials will focus on my [Software Suite](https://prashantnag.com/softwares/), which I've developed and refined through years of experience in the research workflow.

## My Mission

Having navigated the challenges of PhD research myself, I understand the complexities and pain points that researchers face daily. These tools and workflows are derived from real PhD research, publications, and academic teaching experience. Through my software suite and the upcoming tutorials, my goal is to:

- **Streamline your research workflow** - Making complex tasks simpler and more efficient
- **Share practical expertise** - Real-world solutions based on hands-on experience
- **Ease the PhD journey** - Helping you focus on your research, not the tools

All content will be published under the **ResearchInfuser** initiative, focused on practical, reproducible, and researcher-centric tools.

## What to Expect

The tutorials will cover:

- Step-by-step guides for using the software tools
- Best practices learned from years of research experience
- Tips and tricks to optimize your academic workflow
- Real-world examples and use cases

Content will be released in structured series, starting with essential research productivity tools, followed by advanced workflows for thesis writing, experimentation, and publication. Feedback and suggestions from the research community will help shape future tutorials.
