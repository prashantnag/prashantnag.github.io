::: about-link-text
I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Applications](https://galgotiacollege.edu/computer-applications-mca) at [Galgotias College of Engineering & Technology, Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, India.](https://galgotiacollege.edu/galgotias-college-of-engineering-&-technology) My academic and research interests lie in artificial intelligence, deep learning, and affective computing, with a particular focus on emotion detection, cognitive appraisal, and explainable AI.

My work examines how AI models interpret human emotions in text and how transparent, well-grounded analytical methods can enhance understanding, reliability, and human-centered applications. I am committed to advancing rigorous and reproducible AI research while actively contributing to teaching, mentoring, and collaborative academic development.
